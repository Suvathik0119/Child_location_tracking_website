# MR.Child: Child Real-time Location Tracking Website

## Project Overview
MR.Child is a real-time location tracking website designed to help parents monitor their children's whereabouts. This project is developed as a part of my final year project under the guidance of Mr. A.C. Aasik.

## Features
- **Parent and Child Registration/Login:** Both parents and children can register and log in to the website.
- **Real-time Location Sharing:** Children can share their location with their parents after logging in, without needing device permissions.
- **Location Display:** Parents can view their child's location on a map in real-time.

## Project Resources
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end:** PHP, HTML
- **Server and Database:** XAMPP server

## Project Motivation
In the digital age, there are numerous apps available for real-time location tracking. However, many of these apps require premium access for full functionality. This project aims to provide a free, accessible solution for parents to track their children's location in real-time.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to extend my gratitude to my project coordinator, Mr. A.C. Aasik, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this project.
